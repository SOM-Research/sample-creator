# Sample creator 

Implementation package of the "On the Creation of Representative Samples of Software Repositories" paper (under review). 
The running example is showcased in the zenodo repository.

<!-- The data is in a CSV format, containing the targeted variables of the running example: "likes" and "type" named "repository.csv".

For each case of the running example (i.e., one numerical, one categorical, and two variables of different type) we provide a jupyter notebook to reproduce the results, along with the HTML file of the execution.

The dependencies can be installed using the requirements.txt file. -->
