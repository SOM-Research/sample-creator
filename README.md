# Sample Creator

From the template we still have to do:

* If your work is related to a paper, and you want to facilitate its citation, review the `CITATION.cff` file. The provided template will help to fill the gaps, but if you need more help, you can find more information in [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/). Otherwise, just remove the file.

Since the paper is not yet published, do we have to add the citation?
